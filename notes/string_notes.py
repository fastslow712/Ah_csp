#Why do we have strings?
#so we can do things

#How do stupid proofing and sanitization relate to each other?
#sanitization is part of

#What is debugging?
#fixing code

#How do you debug the different types of errors?
#you find them and change the code to remove them.

#Describe what each of the methods below does:
#find()
#findes a number or word in a vareable
#concatenate (add)
#puts to strings together
#upper()
#makes all leaters upper case
#lower()
#makes all leaters loercase
#strip()
#removes extra spaces befor and after a input
#leangth()
#find the leangth of a word or veareable

#sanitization and stupid proofing
# sanitization removing extra spaces corectley captilisies making shure it is the right data type. stupid proofingmaking shure the usre can't break your code

#debuging is fixing code
#thre types of bugs.
#sintax erer, gramer mistake. 
#spaces or tabes in the rong place, forgiting =, or other things, spling error.
#logic error
#error that makes the output worng without making the code unable to run.
#run time error
#a eror that leats the code work untel the code reaches the error.
