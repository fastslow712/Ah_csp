#What is an algorithm?
#a set of instrucshions to compleat a task
name=input("what is your name:\n")
print("hello",name)

#treyson has 12 apples, he has 5 friends he wants to give apples to. howmany apples does each friend get? 2
apples=12
friends=5
print("each friend gets", apples/friends, "apples")

#List steps in an algorithm
#1.declar vareables (get info) 2.proform any equsions ie do the things 3.display results
p1=15
p2=20
p3=45
p4=11
totel_ages=(p1+p2+p3+p4)
print(totel_ages/4)

#List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
#additon same as in math class. subtraction same as in math class. multiplatshion same as in math class. division same as in math class.exponents same as in math class integer division will remove the desimal. modulo remander after deividing.
#intiger whole number. flot desimal number.
num1=12
num2=7
print("additon(+):", num1+num2)
print("subtraction(-):", num1-num2)
print("multiplatshion(*):", num1*num2)
print("division.(/):",num1/num2)
print("division.(/):",round(num1/num2,))#number to round, number of decimal places.
print("exponents(**):", num1**num2)
print("integer division(//):", num1//num2)
print("modulo(%):", num1%num2)

# mathematical operator= is the same as one thing, mathematical operator, another thing 
num1 += num2
print(num1)

#if you don't put int(the input) when asking the user for numbers and useing them in an equshion the anser will be worng.

#Why are expressions so important in programming?
#programing is math lojic without numbers.
